    \title Tutorial: Qt Widgets application

    This tutorial illustrates how to use \QVSC to create a \l {Qt Widgets}
    application. You will need a project that you can develop further using
    VS Code and \QD.

    You can download the completed project from
    \l{https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-labs/vscodeext.git/tree/doc/tutorials/AddressBook}
    {here}.

    \section1 Before you start

    Before you start, you have to:

    \list
        \li \l {Installation}{Install \QVSC}
        \li \l {Register Qt installations}
        \li \l {Create a Qt Widgets application project}
    \endlist

    \section1 Create a Qt Widgets application project

    To develop Qt applications, you need a project folder that has the code and
    a project configuration file (\e CMakeLists.txt) that has instructions for
    building the project.

    The \e AddressBook project has two classes, each with a header, source, and
    UI form:

    \list
        \li \c AddressBook (based on QMainWindow)
        \li \c AddDialog (based on QDialog)
    \endlist

    To create a project:

    \list 1
        \li Create a folder called \e AddressBook.
        \li In VS Code, go to \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {Open Folder}.
        \li Go to \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New File}, and create the
            following files:
            \list
                \li \c main.cpp
                \li \c addressbook.cpp
                \li \c addressbook.h
                \li \c adddialog.cpp
                \li \c adddialog.h
            \endlist
        \li Go to \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New Text File}, and create
            the \e CMakeLists.txt file. For more information about CMake
            configuration files, see \l{Getting started with CMake}.
    \endlist

    Next, create the main window of the application.

    \section1 Design the main window

    Use \QD to design the application's main window, which has
    some widgets placed in layouts:

    \image vscodeext-tutorial-widgets-main-window.webp {AddressBook's main window}

    For more information about using \QD, see \l{\QD}{\QD Manual}.

    \section2 Add widgets

    To add widgets to the UI and to set properties for them:

    \list 1
        \li In VS Code \uicontrol {Explorer}, select \c addressbook.ui, and then
            select \uicontrol {Open this file with \QD} to open it in \QD.
            \image vscodeext-open-ui-file.webp {Opening addressbook.ui in the Explorer}
        \li In the \uicontrol {New Form} dialog, select \uicontrol {Close}.
        \li In \QD's \uicontrol {Widget Box}, select \uicontrol {List Widget} and
            Drag it to the form to add a \l QListWidget.
        \li In the \uicontrol {Property Editor}, set the \c ObjectName property
            to \e addressList.
        \li Drag two \uicontrol {Push Button} widgets to the top-right
            corner of the form to add \l QPushButton objects for the
            \uicontrol Add and \uicontrol Delete buttons.
        \li Set the button names to \e addButton and \e deleteButton and
            \uicontrol text property values to \e Add and \e Delete.
        \li Drag two \uicontrol {Label} widgets to the form to add
            \l QLabel objects for displaying the selected item in the list.
        \li Rename the first label to \e nameLabel and change its
            \uicontrol text property to \e {<No item selected>}.
        \li Rename the second label to \e emailLabel and leave its
            \uicontrol text property empty.
    \endlist

    Position the widgets as they appear in the screenshot above. To properly
    position the widgets and to automatically resize them when the form is
    resized, you need to add layouts to the form.

    \section2 Add widgets to layouts

    You will need a vertical layout for the buttons as well as a spacer to push
    the buttons to the top of the layout. In addition, you will need a second
    layout to manage the positioning of the other widgets as well as the button
    layout.

    To add widgets to layouts:

    \list 1
        \li Drag a \uicontrol {Vertical Spacer} item to the form to add a
            spacer.
        \li Select the buttons and the spacer, and then select \uicontrol Form >
            \uicontrol {Lay Out Vertically} to add a vertical layout
            (\l QVBoxLayout).
        \li Select the list widgets, the two labels, and the button layout,
            and then select \uicontrol Form > \uicontrol {Lay Out in a Grid} to
            add a grid layout (\l QGridLayout).

            \note Make sure that the labels are almost as wide as the form.
            Otherwise, the grid layout will make them only as wide as the
            address list.
        \li Select \uicontrol Form > \uicontrol Preview to preview your form
            without compiling it.
        \li Go to \uicontrol File > \uicontrol Save to save the form.
    \endlist

    Build and run the application to check the main window.

    \section1 Add a dialog

    Now that the main window is ready, move on to add functionality to the
    application. To have the application open a dialog when the user clicks
    the \uicontrol Add button, create an \uicontrol {Add Address} dialog and
    invoke the dialog from a slot that you connect to the \uicontrol Add button.

    To add a dialog:

    \list 1
        \li In \QD, go to \uicontrol File > \uicontrol New, and select
            \uicontrol {Dialog without Buttons}.
        \li Select \uicontrol Create to create the dialog.
        \li In the \uicontrol {Property Editor}, set the \c ObjectName property
            to \e AddDialog.
        \li Go to \uicontrol File > \uicontrol Save, and save the file as
            \e {adddialog.ui}.
    \endlist

    Add the UI file to the project sources in the \e {CMakeLists.txt} file:

    \badcode
    set(PROJECT_SOURCES
            main.cpp
            addressbook.cpp
            addressbook.h
            addressbook.ui
            adddialog.cpp
            adddialog.h
            adddialog.ui
    )
    \endcode

    \section2 Design the dialog

    \image vscodeext-tutorials-widgets-dialog.webp {Add Address Dialog}

    To design the dialog:

    \list 1
        \li In \QD, set \e {Add Address} as the \uicontrol windowTitle.
        \li Add a \uicontrol Label to the form and set its \uicontrol objectName
            property to \e nameText and \uicontrol text property to \e {Name:}.
        \li Add another \uicontrol Label and set its \uicontrol objectName
            property to \e emailText and \uicontrol text property to
            \e {Email:}.
        \li Add a \uicontrol {Line Edit} (\l QLineEdit) and set its
            \uicontrol objectName property to \e nameEdit. Leave the
            \uicontrol text property empty.
        \li Add another \uicontrol {Line Edit} and set its \uicontrol objectName
            property to \e emailEdit. Leave the \uicontrol text property empty.
        \li Select the labels and line edits, and then go to \uicontrol Form >
            \uicontrol {Lay Out in a Grid} to add a grid layout.
        \li Add a \uicontrol {Push Button} and set its \uicontrol objectName
            property to \e okButton and \uicontrol text property to \e OK.
        \li Add a horizontal spacer to the left of the button.
        \li Add a horizontal layout for the spacer and the button.
        \li Add a vertical spacer between the labels and the button.
        \li Add a vertical layout for the labels and the spacer.
        \li Add a grid layout for both layouts.
        \li Go to \uicontrol Form > \uicontrol Preview to preview your form
            without compiling it.
        \li Go to \uicontrol File > \uicontrol Save to save the form.
    \endlist

    \section1 Connect to the dialog's OK button

    To have the \uicontrol OK button invoke the QDialog::accept() slot, click
    the \uicontrol {Edit Signals/Slots} toolbar button to enter
    \l {Qt Designer's Signals and Slots Editing Mode}.

    Click the \uicontrol OK button, drag the mouse cursor to an empty area of
    the form, and release the mouse button. In the
    \uicontrol {Configure Connection} dialog, connect the button's
    QPushButton::clicked() signal to the form's QDialog::accept() slot.

    \section1 Open dialogs from the main window

    To invoke the dialog when the user selects \uicontrol Add in the main
    window, you must add a slot to the \c AddressBook class and invoke
    \c AddDialog from this slot.

    Forms that you create using \QD call QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName() to
    establish connections between signals that the form's child widgets
    emit and slots that follow the naming convention \c {on_<sender>_<signal>()}.
    For the application to react appropriately when the user clicks the
    \uicontrol Add button, you must implement a slot called
    \c{on_addButton_clicked()}.

    To implement the slot, open the \c addressbook.h file in VS Code and
    add a declaration for the slot:

    \code
    private slots:
        void on_addButton_clicked();
    \endcode

    Then open \c addressbook.cpp, and add the slot definition:

    \code
    void AddressBook::on_addButton_clicked()
    {
        AddDialog dialog(this);
        dialog.exec();
    }
    \endcode

    To connect to some other signal, you must add the signal to the
    \c AddressBook class. This requires editing both the header file,
    \c addressbook.h, and the implementation file, \c addressbook.cpp.

    Include \c adddialog.h to \c addressbook.cpp:

    \code
    #include "adddialog.h"
    \endcode

    To test your changes, build and run the application. Select the
    \uicontrol Add button to open the \uicontrol {Add Address} dialog, and then
    select \uicontrol OK to close it.

    \section1 Add items to the list widget

    When the user selects \uicontrol OK, an item should be added to the
    QListWidget. To implement this function, change the code in the
    \c {on_addButton_clicked()} slot, as follows:

    \code
    AddDialog dialog(this);

        if (dialog.exec()) {
            QString name = dialog.nameEdit->text();
            QString email = dialog.emailEdit->text();

            if (!name.isEmpty() && !email.isEmpty()) {
                QListWidgetItem *item = new QListWidgetItem(name, ui.addressList);
                item->setData(Qt::UserRole, email);
                ui.addressList->setCurrentItem(item);
            }
        }
    \endcode

    The dialog is executed. If the user accepts it by selecting \uicontrol OK,
    the \uicontrol Name and \uicontrol Email fields are extracted and a
    QListWidgetItem that has the specified information is created.

    \section1 Display the selected item

    To update the \c nameLabel and the \c emailLabel at the bottom of the form
    when the user selects an item in the list widget, add another slot to the
    \c AddressBook class.

    In the \c addressbook.h file, add the following code in the
    \c{private slots} section of the class:

    \code
    void on_addressList_currentItemChanged();
    \endcode

    Then, add the block of code below to \c addressbook.cpp:

    \code
    void AddressBook::on_addressList_currentItemChanged()
    {
        QListWidgetItem *curItem = ui.addressList->currentItem();

        if (curItem) {
            ui.nameLabel->setText("Name: " + curItem->text());
            ui.emailLabel->setText("Email: " + curItem->data(Qt::UserRole).toString());
        } else {
            ui.nameLabel->setText("<No item selected>");
            ui.emailLabel->clear();
        }
    }
    \endcode

    The naming convention enables this slot to be automatically connected
    to the QListWidget::currentItemChanged() signal of \c{addressList} and
    be invoked whenever the selected item in the list changes.

    \section1 Add functionality for the Delete button

    To implement a slot for the \uicontrol Delete button, open the
    \c addressbook.h file in Visual Studio and add a declaration for the
    \c on_deleteButton_clicked() slot. Then open \c addressbook.cpp and add the
    slot definition for \c on_deleteButton_clicked().

    Type the following code in the slot's body:

    \code
    void AddressBook::on_deleteButton_clicked()
    {
        QListWidgetItem *curItem = ui.addressList->currentItem();

        if (curItem) {
            int row = ui.addressList->row(curItem);
            ui.addressList->takeItem(row);
            delete curItem;

            if (ui.addressList->count() > 0)
                ui.addressList->setCurrentRow(0);
            else
                on_addressList_currentItemChanged();
        }
    }
    \endcode

    Your application is now complete.
